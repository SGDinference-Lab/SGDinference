__SGDinference__ is an R package that provides estimation and inference methods for large-scale mean and quantile regression models via stochastic (sub-)gradient descent (S-subGD) algorithms. The inference procedure handles cross-sectional data sequentially: 

  (i) updating the parameter estimate with each incoming "new observation", 
  (ii) aggregating it as a Polyak-Ruppert average, and 
  (iii) computing an asympotically pivotal statistic for inference through random scaling.

The methodology used in the SGDinference package is described in detail in the following papers:
